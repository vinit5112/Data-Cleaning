character,dialog
Harry Potter,"Yes, Aunt Petunia."
Harry Potter,"Yes, Uncle Vernon."
Harry Potter,He's asleep!
Harry Potter,"Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you.  Can you...hear me?  It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often?  You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family?  I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either."
Harry Potter,Anytime.
Harry Potter,Ow!
Harry Potter,"I swear I don't know!  One minute, the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!"
Harry Potter,"Will I have to wear that, too?"
Harry Potter,But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old Elephant skin.
Harry Potter,"Hey, give it back! It's mine!"
Harry Potter,Because there's no post on Sunday?
Harry Potter,Get off! Ahh!
Harry Potter,They're my letters! Let go of me!
Harry Potter,"Make a wish, Harry."
Harry Potter,I-I am.
Harry Potter,Thank you!
Harry Potter,"Excuse me, who are you?"
Harry Potter,"Sorry, no."
Harry Potter,Learned what?
Harry Potter,I-I'm a what?
Harry Potter,"No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry."
Harry Potter,"Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."
Harry Potter,You knew? You knew all along and you never told me?
Harry Potter,Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!
Harry Potter,Muggle?
Harry Potter,Okay.
Harry Potter,"First year students will require: three sets of work robes, one wand."
Harry Potter,"One pair of dragon-hide gloves.  Hagrid, do they mean for a real dragon?"
Harry Potter,But you like a dragon?
Harry Potter,"All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Could we find all this in London?"
Harry Potter,"Oh, nice to meet you."
Harry Potter,Goodbye.
Harry Potter,"But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?"
Harry Potter,"But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money."
Harry Potter,"Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are these things?"
Harry Potter,"What's in there, Hagrid?"
Harry Potter,I still need...a wand.
Harry Potter,Hello? Hello?
Harry Potter,"Sorry, but what's curious?"
Harry Potter,And...who owned that wand?
Harry Potter,Wow.
Harry Potter,"He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do."
Harry Potter,Maybe if you wrote it down?
Harry Potter,Voldemort?
Harry Potter,Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?
Harry Potter,What happened to...to You-Know-Who?
Harry Potter,"Platform 9¾? But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9¾. There's no such thing...is there?"
Harry Potter,"Excuse me, excuse me."
Harry Potter,"Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9¾?"
Harry Potter,Muggles?
Harry Potter,Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to-
Harry Potter,"No, not at all."
Harry Potter,I'm Harry. Harry Potter.
Harry Potter,The what?
Harry Potter,Oh
Harry Potter,We'll take the lot!
Harry Potter,Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?
Harry Potter,"These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?"
Harry Potter,I got Dumbledore!
Harry Potter,"Hey, he's gone!"
Harry Potter,A little.
Harry Potter,Yeah!
Harry Potter,"Hey, Hagrid."
Harry Potter,"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks."
Harry Potter,Ahh!
Harry Potter,"Nothing... nothing, I'm fine."
Harry Potter,Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.
Harry Potter,Not Slytherin...anything but Slytherin.
Harry Potter,Wow.
Harry Potter,"Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?"
Harry Potter,What's he teach?
Harry Potter,I think she fancies you.
Harry Potter,We got lost.
Harry Potter,"I don't know, sir."
Harry Potter,"I don't know, sir."
Harry Potter,"Clearly, Hermione knows. Since it's a pity not to ask her."
Harry Potter,What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
Harry Potter,Can I borrow this?  Thanks.
Harry Potter,"Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts, listen.  Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to."
Harry Potter,Wow.
Harry Potter,Neville!
Harry Potter,"Give it here, Malfoy."
Harry Potter,"Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!"
Harry Potter,"A century, according to McGonagall."
Harry Potter,But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?
Harry Potter,I-I didn't know.
Harry Potter,Who doesn't?
Harry Potter,What's happening?
Harry Potter,Let's go this way.
Harry Potter,Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?
Harry Potter,Let's go.
Harry Potter,Run!
Harry Potter,Quick! Let’s hide though that door!
Harry Potter,It's locked!
Harry Potter,And for good reason.
Harry Potter,Guarding something?
Harry Potter,I think so. What are those?
Harry Potter,What is that?
Harry Potter,I like this ball.
Harry Potter,What do I do with it?
Harry Potter,Whoa.
Harry Potter,"I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor."
Harry Potter,I think she heard you.
Harry Potter,Where's Hermione?
Harry Potter,How could a troll get in?
Harry Potter,Hermione! She doesn't know!
Harry Potter,It’s going into the Girl's Bathroom!
Harry Potter,"Hermione, move!"
Harry Potter,"Whooa! Whoa, whoa!"
Harry Potter,"Whoa, whoa whoa!"
Harry Potter,Do something!
Harry Potter,Anything! Hurry up!
Harry Potter,I don't think so. Just knocked out.  Ew. Troll bogies.
Harry Potter,"Well, what it is..."
Harry Potter,Good for you to get us out of trouble like that.
Harry Potter,"Mind you, she didn't need saving if you hadn't insulted her."
Harry Potter,I'm not hungry.
Harry Potter,That explains the blood.
Harry Potter,"Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping."
Harry Potter,"The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret."
Harry Potter,That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.
Harry Potter,But I-I never get mail.
Harry Potter,It's a broomstick!
Harry Potter,But who...?
Harry Potter,A little.
Harry Potter,What happened?
Harry Potter,Yes!  Whoa!
Harry Potter,Yes!
Harry Potter,Whoa! Whooa!
Harry Potter,Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?
Harry Potter,Yes?
Harry Potter,"But, Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it."
Harry Potter,Exactly.
Harry Potter,Nicholas Flamel?
Harry Potter,Nicholas Flamel.  Who's Nicholas Flamel?
Harry Potter,Knight to E5.
Harry Potter,"Happy Christmas, Ron.  What are you wearing?"
Harry Potter,I-I've got presents?
Harry Potter,Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well.
Harry Potter,It's some kind of cloak.
Harry Potter,My body's gone!
Harry Potter,I'm invisible?
Harry Potter,There was no name. It just said use it well.
Harry Potter,Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?
Harry Potter,Mum?  Dad?
Harry Potter,"Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this!  Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!"
Harry Potter,"There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!"
Harry Potter,"Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!"
Harry Potter,"Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad"
Harry Potter,How can it? Both my parents are dead.
Harry Potter,No.
Harry Potter,No.
Harry Potter,"So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?"
Harry Potter,"Hi, Hedwig."
Harry Potter,Malfoy.
Harry Potter,I found him!
Harry Potter,Go on.
Harry Potter,I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that day.
Harry Potter,The what?
Harry Potter,Shh!
Harry Potter,Hagrid!
Harry Potter,We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
Harry Potter,We think Snape's trying to steal it.
Harry Potter,"Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why."
Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter,Wait a minute.  One of the teachers?
Harry Potter,"Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?"
Harry Potter,Norbert?
Harry Potter,Malfoy.
Harry Potter,Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.
Harry Potter,I don't understand. Is that bad?
Harry Potter,50?!
Harry Potter,"Hagrid, what's that?"
Harry Potter,"If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared."
Harry Potter,"What is it, Fang?"
Harry Potter,But what was that thing you saved me from?
Harry Potter,But who would choose such a life?
Harry Potter,Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?
Harry Potter,The Philosopher's Stone.
Harry Potter,"But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong! Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself; he wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll... he'll come back."
Harry Potter,"I think if he'd had the chance, he might've tried to kill me tonight."
Harry Potter,My scar. It keeps burning.
Harry Potter,Not like this.
Harry Potter,I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh!  Oh. Of course!
Harry Potter,"Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one?  I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?  What did he look like?"
Harry Potter,"The stranger, though, you and he must have talked."
Harry Potter,And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
Harry Potter,"We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!"
Harry Potter,He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone.
Harry Potter,Someone's going to try and steal it.
Harry Potter,"That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy."
Harry Potter,We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.
Harry Potter,Trevor.
Harry Potter,"Now, Neville, listen. We were"
Harry Potter,Let's go.  Sorry.
Harry Potter,Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp.
Harry Potter,We have to move its paw.
Harry Potter,"Come on!  Okay. Push!  I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign.  If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?"
Harry Potter,Jump! Go!
Harry Potter,Whoa!  Oh. Ahh!
Harry Potter,Hermione!!
Harry Potter,Hermione! Where are you?!
Harry Potter,"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."
Harry Potter,Apparently not.
Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter,"Ron, are you okay?"
Harry Potter,Okay.
Harry Potter,Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.
Harry Potter,I don't know. Sounds like wings.
Harry Potter,"They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door."
Harry Potter,I don't know. Strange.
Harry Potter,There! I see it!  The one with the broken wing!
Harry Potter,It's too simple.
Harry Potter,Catch the key!
Harry Potter,Where are we? A graveyard.
Harry Potter,There's the door.
Harry Potter,Wait a minute.
Harry Potter,"No, Ron! No!"
Harry Potter,He's going to sacrifice himself!
Harry Potter,"RON!  NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing.  Checkmate.  Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on."
Harry Potter,Not as good as you.
Harry Potter,"You?  No. I-it can’t be. Snape, h-he was the one—-"
Harry Potter,"But-but that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me."
Harry Potter,Snape was trying to save me?
Harry Potter,Then-then you let the troll in.
Harry Potter,I-I’m shaking hands with Dumbledore. I’ve won the House Cup.
Harry Potter,Voldemort.
Harry Potter,Never!
Harry Potter,You liar!
Harry Potter,Admirers?
Harry Potter,Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?
Harry Potter,"But, what happened to the Stone?"
Harry Potter,"But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?"
Harry Potter,"How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next..."
Harry Potter,"Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?"
Harry Potter,What is it?
Harry Potter,"All right there, Ron?"
Harry Potter,All right. Hermione?
Harry Potter,One minute.
Harry Potter,"Thanks, Hagrid."
Harry Potter,"But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that."
Harry Potter,I'm not going home. Not really.
Harry Potter,"I can't let you out, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon…"
Harry Potter,Now you've done it.
Harry Potter,But she's bored! If I could only let outonly let out for an hour or two.
Harry Potter,But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends… not one… all summer.
Harry Potter,"I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don't exist."
Harry Potter,Who are you?
Harry Potter,"Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom."
Harry Potter,Why don't you sit down?
Harry Potter,"Dobby, ssh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to offend you, or anything."
Harry Potter,You can't have met many decent wizards then.
Harry Potter,"Stop, Dobby!"
Harry Potter,"Dobby, shh!"
Harry Potter,"Dobby, please stop!"
Harry Potter,"Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please be quiet! Are you all right?"
Harry Potter,Your family?
Harry Potter,What terrible things? Who's plotting them?
Harry Potter,Ok– I- understand. You can't- say.
Harry Potter,"Dobby! Dobby, put the lamp down."
Harry Potter,Give me the lamp! Dobby stop!
Harry Potter,"Get in there, and keep quiet!"
Harry Potter,I- I was just—
Harry Potter,Sorry.
Harry Potter,"Yes, sir… See why I've got to go back? I don't belong here. I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. It's the only place I've got friends!"
Harry Potter,"Well, I expect they've… been- hang on- how do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?"
Harry Potter,"Give me those, now!"
Harry Potter,"Dobby, get back here!"
Harry Potter,"Dobby, please, no!"
Harry Potter,I can't. Hogwarts is my home!
Harry Potter,Ron! Fred. George. What are you all doing here?
Harry Potter,Ahh- ahh!
Harry Potter,Let go of me!
Harry Potter,Get off!
Harry Potter,I think it's brilliant
Harry Potter,Hello. W-what did I do?
Harry Potter,Raids?
Harry Potter,"Oh, sorry sir. I'm Harry, sir, Harry Potter."
Harry Potter,"Oh, it…"
Harry Potter,"Oh, umm…"
Harry Potter,Floo powder?
Harry Potter,'Diaganilly.'
Harry Potter,"I'm fine, thank you. I- I was just…"
Harry Potter,No! Please!
Harry Potter,Hagrid!
Harry Potter,"I was lost, I— hang on. What were you doing down there, then?"
Harry Potter,"Well, it's great to see you, too!"
Harry Potter,I definitely need to remember that one.
Harry Potter,Thank you. Bye.
Harry Potter,Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer.
Harry Potter,Let's go.
Harry Potter,Aah!
Harry Potter,Sorry. Lost- lost control of the trolley. Why can't we get through?
Harry Potter,The train leaves at exactly eleven o'clock. We've missed it!
Harry Potter,Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
Harry Potter,"Ron, I should tell you, most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car."
Harry Potter,"Well come on, then. Let's go lower. We need to find the train."
Harry Potter,Now all we need to do is catch up with the train.
Harry Potter,Do you hear that?
Harry Potter,Hold on…
Harry Potter,Aaahhh! Aaahhhh! Aaahhh!
Harry Potter,Wha-aahhh!
Harry Potter,I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.
Harry Potter,I think we found the train.
Harry Potter,Up! Up!
Harry Potter,Up! Up! Ron! Mind that tree!
Harry Potter,Ahh!
Harry Potter,Be thankful it's not your neck.
Harry Potter,I don't know.
Harry Potter,Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
Harry Potter,Aaaahhhh!
Harry Potter,Come on! Go! Fast!
Harry Potter,Ahh!
Harry Potter,"See you, Hedwig. So, a house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to platform nine and three-quarters, we almost get killed by a tree… clearly someone doesn't want me here this year."
Harry Potter,Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall.
Harry Potter,You're doomed.
Harry Potter,"Oh- Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you."
Harry Potter,Stop! Stop! Hold still!
Harry Potter,Malfoy?
Harry Potter,"No, Colin! Get out of the way! Let's take him to Hagrid's."
Harry Potter,He'll know what to do.
Harry Potter,Ah! Oh… Okay.
Harry Potter,"Malfoy. He called Hermione, …um, well, I don't- I don't know exactly what it means."
Harry Potter,What's a Mudblood?
Harry Potter,That's horrible!
Harry Potter,Not really.
Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter,That voice.
Harry Potter,Didn't you hear it?
Harry Potter,Spooky.
Harry Potter,Did you hear it?
Harry Potter,That voice.
Harry Potter,I heard it first in Lockhart's office. And then again just—
Harry Potter,It's moving. I think it's going to kill.
Harry Potter,Strange. I've never seen spiders act like that.
Harry Potter,"Oh, no… It's Filch's cat. It's Mrs. Norris."
Harry Potter,No. No.
Harry Potter,"It's not true sir, I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris."
Harry Potter,When I said I wasn't hungry. We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.
Harry Potter,Strange?
Harry Potter,"Do you think I should have told them? Dumbledore and the others, I mean?"
Harry Potter,"Well, if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, a-and it really has been opened, then that means---"
Harry Potter,"Well, maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries."
Harry Potter,"Well, how long will it take to make?"
Harry Potter,"A month? But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then."
Harry Potter,Wood! Look out!
Harry Potter,Thank you.
Harry Potter,"No, I think my- I think my arm's broken."
Harry Potter,"No, not you."
Harry Potter,Ugh!
Harry Potter,Uh!
Harry Potter,Dobby?
Harry Potter,It was you… You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.
Harry Potter,You nearly got Ron and me expelled!
Harry Potter,Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
Harry Potter,"You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!"
Harry Potter,I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?
Harry Potter,Why do you wear that thing Dobby?
Harry Potter,Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?
Harry Potter,"Dobby, stop it! Stop it! Stop, Dobby! Tell me, Dobby. When did this happen before? Who's doing it now?"
Harry Potter,"No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it?"
Harry Potter,"Thank you, sir."
Harry Potter,You wish.
Harry Potter,Rictusempra!
Harry Potter,Sya- hassa- she. Sya- hasi- heth. Sya- hasi- heth.
Harry Potter,I'm a what?
Harry Potter,"I know. I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. Uh, once! But, so what? I bet loads of people here can do it."
Harry Potter,What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin.
Harry Potter,You were there! You heard me!
Harry Potter,I spoke a different language? But- I didn't realize I- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?
Harry Potter,But I'm not… I can't be.
Harry Potter,I'll see you back in the common room.
Harry Potter,No! Mr. Filch! Y-you- you don't understand!
Harry Potter,Professor… I swear I didn't!
Harry Potter,Professor Dumbledore?
Harry Potter,I… I-I was- I was just wondering if you'd put me in the right house.
Harry Potter,You're wrong.
Harry Potter,"Professor! Sir, your bird- there was nothing I could do- he- he just caught fire!"
Harry Potter,"You don't think it was me, Professor?"
Harry Potter,"No, sir. Nothing."
Harry Potter,Crabbe and Goyle.
Harry Potter,"Ron, maybe I should do it?"
Harry Potter,Wingardium leviosa. Here they come.
Harry Potter,Come on. Let's get 'em.
Harry Potter,Ughh!
Harry Potter,Ron!
Harry Potter,We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe.
Harry Potter,Excellent.
Harry Potter,"Hermione, are you okay?"
Harry Potter,Come on.
Harry Potter,I think the Slytherin common room's this way.
Harry Potter,I'm…
Harry Potter,Ah- um… Reading.
Harry Potter,Uh-huh.
Harry Potter,You're wrong!
Harry Potter,Harry Potter?
Harry Potter,But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.
Harry Potter,It's his… stomachache. Calm down.
Harry Potter,Hair!
Harry Potter,"Hermione, come out. We've got loads to tell you!"
Harry Potter,Hermione? A- are you OK?
Harry Potter,"She should be out of hospital in a few days, when she stops coughing up fur balls… What's this?"
Harry Potter,Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.
Harry Potter,Why would I throw something at you?
Harry Potter,"But, who threw it at you, anyway?"
Harry Potter,'Tom Marvolo Riddle.'
Harry Potter,'My name is Harry Potter.'
Harry Potter,'Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?'
Harry Potter,'Can you tell me?'
Harry Potter,Excuse me. Could you tell me what's going on here? Are you Tom Riddle?
Harry Potter,Dumbledore?
Harry Potter,Hagrid! Haagriid!
Harry Potter,Woah!
Harry Potter,It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chanter of Secrets fifty years ago.
Harry Potter,"The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?"
Harry Potter,No!
Harry Potter,"W- what's that you've got, Hagrid?"
Harry Potter,And they found it. Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
Harry Potter,No.
Harry Potter,"We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him, but if he did set the monster loose last time, he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that's a start."
Harry Potter,I think it's time to get my Dad's old cloak out again.
Harry Potter,What's that for?
Harry Potter,"Hagrid, are you okay?"
Harry Potter,Did you hear about Hermione?
Harry Potter,"Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?"
Harry Potter,"Look! Well, come on. Come on, Fang!"
Harry Potter,You heard what Hagrid said; 'Follow the spiders.'
Harry Potter,Shush!
Harry Potter,Come on!
Harry Potter,Don't panic.
Harry Potter,We're friends of Hagrid's. And you? Y- y-you're Aragog aren't you?
Harry Potter,"He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets, like before."
Harry Potter,Then you're not the monster.
Harry Potter,"Shush. But if you're not the monster, then- then what did kill that girl fifty years ago?"
Harry Potter,But have you seen it?
Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter,"Well, thank you. We'll just…go."
Harry Potter,"One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them."
Harry Potter,Let's go! Arania exumai! Go!
Harry Potter,Whoah!
Harry Potter,Arania exumai!
Harry Potter,Don't mention it. Get us out of here. Now! Come on! Come on! Move faster!
Harry Potter,Aah!
Harry Potter,Go on! Go! Get us in the air.
Harry Potter,Come on! Pull!
Harry Potter,We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.
Harry Potter,"Wish you were here Hermione. We need you… now, more than ever."
Harry Potter,"Ron, this is why Hermione was in the Library the day she was attacked. Come on!"
Harry Potter,"'Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it.' Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake!"
Harry Potter,"Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. Justin…Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it- but he's a ghost- he couldn't die again. And Hermione…had the mirror. I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners, in case it came along."
Harry Potter,The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the basilisk's reflection. 'Spiders flee before it.' It all fits!
Harry Potter,"Hermione's answered that, too."
Harry Potter,"Remember what Aragog said, about that girl fifty years ago? She died in a bathroom? What if she never left?"
Harry Potter,"Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber. At least we can tell him what we know."
Harry Potter,"Professor, we have some information for you! Are you going somewhere?"
Harry Potter,You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?
Harry Potter,You wrote them!
Harry Potter,You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!
Harry Potter,Don't even think about it.
Harry Potter,To ask you how you died.
Harry Potter,Who was it Myrtle?
Harry Potter,Just like that? How?
Harry Potter,"This is it. This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets."
Harry Potter,Hesha- Hassah.
Harry Potter,"Oh, yes there is! You first."
Harry Potter,All right. Let's go.
Harry Potter,Uh…thanks Myrtle.
Harry Potter,Aaah!
Harry Potter,"Now remember, any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway."
Harry Potter,This way.
Harry Potter,It's a snakeskin.
Harry Potter,"Ron! Ron, are you ok?"
Harry Potter,You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. I'll go on and find Ginny!
Harry Potter,Hesha- Hassah.
Harry Potter,"Ginny… Ginny! Oh, Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up. Wake up! Please, wake up!"
Harry Potter,"Tom. Tom Riddle! What do you mean, 'she won't wake?' She's not…?"
Harry Potter,Are you a ghost?
Harry Potter,"She's cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up! You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk."
Harry Potter,"Give me my wand, Tom."
Harry Potter,"Listen, we've got to go! We've got to save her!"
Harry Potter,No. She couldn't. She wouldn't!
Harry Potter,But why?
Harry Potter,"But, why did you want to meet me?"
Harry Potter,"Hagrid's my friend! And you framed him, didn't you?"
Harry Potter,I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
Harry Potter,"Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready, and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again."
Harry Potter,Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
Harry Potter,You! You're the Heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort.
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
Harry Potter,He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Fawkes?
Harry Potter,Ginny-
Harry Potter,Ginny…
Harry Potter,"Don't worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber, and you'll find Ron. You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn't quick enough… Of course! Phoenix tears have healing powers. Thanks! It's alright, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory."
Harry Potter,"Yes, sir."
Harry Potter,"Yes, sir."
Harry Potter,"It's just… You see, sir I- I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain- certain similarities, between Tom Riddle and me."
Harry Potter,Voldemort transferred some of his powers… to me?
Harry Potter,So the Sorting Hat was right! I should be in Slytherin.
Harry Potter,Because I asked it to.
Harry Potter,Godric Gryffindor.
Harry Potter,Dobby! So this is your master! The family you serve is the Malfoys
Harry Potter,Don't worry. I will be.
Harry Potter,"Sir, I wonder if I could have that?"
Harry Potter,Mr. Malfoy! Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours.
Harry Potter,"Oh, I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley."
Harry Potter,Open it.
Harry Potter,Just promise me something.
Harry Potter,Never try to save my life again.
Harry Potter,"Well, we had loads of help from you. We couldn't have done it without you."
Harry Potter,"Well, there's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid."
Harry Potter,Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima!
Harry Potter,"Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form."
Harry Potter,Nothing. School stuff.
Harry Potter,I will if she does.
Harry Potter,Yes.
Harry Potter,Okay.
Harry Potter,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times."
Harry Potter,That's a lie!
Harry Potter,My dad wasn't a drunk!
Harry Potter,Shut up! Shut up!
Harry Potter,No! She deserved what she got! Keep away from me.
Harry Potter,Yeah? Try me.
Harry Potter,I don't care. Anywhere's better than here.
Harry Potter,I fell over.
Harry Potter,I didn't do it on purpose.
Harry Potter,Nothing.
Harry Potter,I didn't.
Harry Potter,The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
Harry Potter,But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
Harry Potter,Who is that? That man.
Harry Potter,How did he escape?
Harry Potter,Yeah. Him I've heard of.
Harry Potter,Hedwig.
Harry Potter,"No, thank you. Minister?"
Harry Potter,I don't understand.
Harry Potter,I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
Harry Potter,"The state of things, sir?"
Harry Potter,"Sirius Black, you mean? But what's he got to do with me?"
Harry Potter,Hedwig.
Harry Potter,Egypt. What's it like?
Harry Potter,Mrs. Weasley.
Harry Potter,Good to see you.
Harry Potter,Yes.
Harry Potter,"Yeah, it's all upstairs."
Harry Potter,Everything's there.
Harry Potter,Thank you.
Harry Potter,Mr. Weasley.
Harry Potter,"Yeah, sure."
Harry Potter,Yeah. It should be great.
Harry Potter,"Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?"
Harry Potter,Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
Harry Potter,Voldemort.
Harry Potter,Sorry.
Harry Potter,And kill me.
Harry Potter,Mr. Weasley... why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Harry Potter,I didn't mean to blow her up. I just... I lost control.
Harry Potter,I think I was lucky not to be arrested actually.
Harry Potter,Do you think he's really asleep?
Harry Potter,I gotta tell you something.
Harry Potter,Yeah.
Harry Potter,"Thanks, Ron."
Harry Potter,I don't know. Maybe we've broken down.
Harry Potter,Thank you.
Harry Potter,What was that thing that came?
Harry Potter,What happened to me?
Harry Potter,And did either of you two... you know... pass out?
Harry Potter,But someone was screaming. A woman.
Harry Potter,How did he find out?
Harry Potter,Fortuna Major.
Harry Potter,Thank you.
Harry Potter,"She's still doing that after three years. She can't even sing. Exactly. Hey, man. Hey, man. Oh, God. That's awful."
Harry Potter,"Shut up, Malfoy."
Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter,"Hey, hey, hey!"
Harry Potter,"Brilliant, professor."
Harry Potter,At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
Harry Potter,"But professor I thought if you signed it, then I could..."
Harry Potter,"Forget about it, guys. See you later."
Harry Potter,"Professor, can I ask you something?"
Harry Potter,I did think of Voldemort at first. But then I remembered that night on the train... and the dementor.
Harry Potter,Before I fainted... I heard something. A woman... screaming.
Harry Potter,I think it was my mother... the night she was murdered.
Harry Potter,The most haunted building in Britain. Yeah I know. What's going on?
Harry Potter,"Excuse me, sir. Where's Professor Lupin?"
Harry Potter,"Sir, it's Quidditch tomorrow."
Harry Potter,Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
Harry Potter,"Oh, brilliant."
Harry Potter,What happened?
Harry Potter,Really? I meant the match. Who won?
Harry Potter,"No. Professor, why do the dementors affect me so? I mean, more than everyone else?"
Harry Potter,"I'm scared, professor."
Harry Potter,I need to know how to fight them. You could teach me. You made that dementor on the train go away.
Harry Potter,But you made it go away.
Harry Potter,"Guys, let me go."
Harry Potter,I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
Harry Potter,"Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't..."
Harry Potter,What are you doing?!
Harry Potter,What's this rubbish?
Harry Potter,"Mr's. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs... are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
Harry Potter,Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that... No. Is that really...?
Harry Potter,So you mean this map shows...
Harry Potter,Everyone?
Harry Potter,Brilliant! Where did you get it?
Harry Potter,"He was their friend... and he betrayed them. He was their friend! I hope he finds me. Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready! When he does, I'm gonna kill him!"
Harry Potter,I'm sure.
Harry Potter,Expecto Patronum.
Harry Potter,Expecto Patronum! Expecto... Expecto... Expect...
Harry Potter,That's one nasty dementor.
Harry Potter,The first time I rode a broom.
Harry Potter,"There's another. It's not... happy, exactly. Well, it is. It's the happiest I've ever felt... but it's complicated."
Harry Potter,Just do it. Expecto Patronum! Expecto Patronum!
Harry Potter,I think I've had enough for today.
Harry Potter,I was thinking of him. And Mom. Seeing their faces. They were talking to me. Just talking. That's the memory I chose. I don't even know if it's real. But it's the best I have.
Harry Potter,Ripped to pieces? What are you talking about?
Harry Potter,They're not sacking you!
Harry Potter,You tell those spiders Ron.
Harry Potter,Sorry.
Harry Potter,Mischief managed. Nox.
Harry Potter,I was sleepwalking.
Harry Potter,"My dad didn't strut. And nor do I. Now, if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand."
Harry Potter,Spare bit of parchment.
Harry Potter,"Mr's. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs... offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
Harry Potter,And request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business.
Harry Potter,"No. No, sir."
Harry Potter,"Yes, sir."
Harry Potter,"Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works. Earlier, it showed someone in the castle. Someone I know to be dead."
Harry Potter,Peter Pettigrew.
Harry Potter,"It's just what I saw. Good night, professor."
Harry Potter,Hang on. We better take this back.
Harry Potter,Fine. See you later.
Harry Potter,Professor Trelawney...
Harry Potter,Sorry?
Harry Potter,No. Nothing.
Harry Potter,Why don't we just set him free?
Harry Potter,Ow! Hagrid!
Harry Potter,Hagrid. It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter,Wait!
Harry Potter,"That's not good. Ron, run!"
Harry Potter,Ron! Ron! Ron! Ron! Come on! Move!
Harry Potter,Don't worry.
Harry Potter,I have a hunch. I just hope I'm wrong.
Harry Potter,Come on. Ron.
Harry Potter,Then it'll be you!
Harry Potter,I know why. You betrayed my parents. You're the reason they're dead!
Harry Potter,"Who was it, then?"
Harry Potter,Expelliarmus!
Harry Potter,Tell me about Peter.
Harry Potter,No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
Harry Potter,"The map was lying, then."
Harry Potter,All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
Harry Potter,"Show me. Give it to him, Ron."
Harry Potter,No!
Harry Potter,I know what he is. But we'll take him to the castle.
Harry Potter,"Get off! I said we'd take you to the castle. After that, the dementors can have you."
Harry Potter,Okay.
Harry Potter,"No. Don't worry, okay? It's fine. I'll stay."
Harry Potter,You okay?
Harry Potter,"Well I just didn't think my dad would have wanted his two best friends... to become killers. Besides, dead, the truth dies with him. Alive, you're free."
Harry Potter,I know.
Harry Potter,What? Come and live with you?
Harry Potter,Expelliarmus!
Harry Potter,Come on.
Harry Potter,Sirius!
Harry Potter,Sirius! No. Sirius! Expecto Patronum!
Harry Potter,I saw my dad.
Harry Potter,He sent the dementors away. I saw him across the lake.
Harry Potter,You mean they're gonna kill him?
Harry Potter,It's true. Sirius is innocent.
Harry Potter,What just happened? Where's Ron?
Harry Potter,I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?
Harry Potter,"Hermione! Hermione! Hermione, wait. Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?"
Harry Potter,That's us.
Harry Potter,This is not normal.
Harry Potter,You mean we've gone back in time?
Harry Potter,Good punch.
Harry Potter,Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.
Harry Potter,Look. Buckbeak's still alive.
Harry Potter,Here they come. I'd better hurry.
Harry Potter,That's Pettigrew.
Harry Potter,He betrayed my parents. You don't expect me to sit here.
Harry Potter,Are you mad?
Harry Potter,Ow!
Harry Potter,Ow! That hurt!
Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter,Get away. Get off.
Harry Potter,This way.
Harry Potter,"Come on. This way. This way, now. Now what?"
Harry Potter,How?
Harry Potter,And now we wait.
Harry Potter,Yeah. Hermione?
Harry Potter,"Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius... I did see someone. That someone made the dementors go away."
Harry Potter,It was my dad. My dad conjured the Patronus.
Harry Potter,You see Sirius talking to me there? He's asking me to come live with him.
Harry Potter,"When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'. It'll just be me and him. We could live in the country... someplace you can see the sky. I think he'll like that after all those years in Azkaban."
Harry Potter,Let's go! What are you doing?
Harry Potter,Thanks. Great! Now he's coming for us.
Harry Potter,Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night. Sirius! Come on!
Harry Potter,Don't worry. My dad will come. He'll conjure the Patronus. Any minute now! Right there! You'll see!
Harry Potter,"Don't worry, he will! He will come! Sirius."
Harry Potter,Expecto Patronum!
Harry Potter,"You were right, Hermione. It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me! I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before. I knew I could do it this time because... well, I had already done it. Does that make sense?"
Harry Potter,I want to go with you.
Harry Potter,But you're innocent.
Harry Potter,My mother's eyes.
Harry Potter,He's free. We did it.
Harry Potter,"I don't know. Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once?"
Harry Potter,You've been sacked.
Harry Potter,Resigned? Why?
Harry Potter,But Dumbledore...
Harry Potter,None of it made any difference. Pettigrew escaped.
Harry Potter,What are you talking about?
Harry Potter,For me? But who sent it?
Harry Potter,Hermione. Bad dream. When did you get here?
Harry Potter,Last night.
Harry Potter,Where are we actually going?
Harry Potter,Yes sir. This way.
Harry Potter,Pleasure to meet you too sir.
Harry Potter,Why are they all standing around that manky old boot?
Harry Potter,What's a 'portkey'?
Harry Potter,Thanks.
Harry Potter,See ya later Cedric.
Harry Potter,I love magic.
Harry Potter,When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!
Harry Potter,What is that?
Harry Potter,Crime?
Harry Potter,What crime?
Harry Potter,"Those people tonight, in the masks... they're his too aren't they? they're his followers."
Harry Potter,There was a man. Before. There.
Harry Potter,I dunno. I didn't see his face.
Harry Potter,It's alright I'll get it.
Harry Potter,Oh no thank you I'm not hungry.
Harry Potter,I'm fine.
Harry Potter,Well there's something you don't see every day.
Harry Potter,I don't know but I don't think it's Pumpkin Juice.
Harry Potter,Yeah well rather you than me.
Harry Potter,No sir.
Harry Potter,No sir.
Harry Potter,Yes sir.
Harry Potter,Let you know what?
Harry Potter,I didn't ask for this to happen Ron. Okay? You're being stupid.
Harry Potter,"I didn't put my name in that cup. I don't want eternal glory I just wanna be.. Look, I don't know what happened tonight and I don't know why, it just did ok."
Harry Potter,It's a broomcupboard.
Harry Potter,"Oh, no."
Harry Potter,I'm fourteen.
Harry Potter,I dunno I haven't really thought about it.
Harry Potter,Fourteen.
Harry Potter,No I didn't enter.
Harry Potter,"Hey, my eyes aren't glistening with the ghosts of my past."
Harry Potter,Sirius?
Harry Potter,Sirius?! How...
Harry Potter,No!
Harry Potter,I dunno.
Harry Potter,No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important.
Harry Potter,"He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. I mean it was only a dream right?"
Harry Potter,What are you saying?
Harry Potter,Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet?
Harry Potter,I'm not ready for this Sirius.
Harry Potter,Someone's coming!
Harry Potter,Who says I was talking to anyone.
Harry Potter,"Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't be the first time."
Harry Potter,Neville! You're doing it again!
Harry Potter,Magical water plants of the highland Lochs?
Harry Potter,Is that right? Well.... what?
Harry Potter,Well you can tell Ronald...
Harry Potter,Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where are we going?
Harry Potter,What's with the flower? Hagrid have you combed your hair?
Harry Potter,Dragons? That's the first task? You're joking.
Harry Potter,Ron was here?
Harry Potter,No he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing.
Harry Potter,Thanks.
Harry Potter,Excuse me..
Harry Potter,Can I have a word?
Harry Potter,Dragons. That's the first task. They've got one for each of us.
Harry Potter,Yes.
Harry Potter,Don't worry about it.
Harry Potter,You're a right foul git you know that?
Harry Potter,I know so.
Harry Potter,Yeah. Stay away from me.
Harry Potter,"I don't give a damn what you or your father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic."
Harry Potter,Oh... um... You know I just thought I'd...
Harry Potter,Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I'm a fair flyer.
Harry Potter,But I'm not allowed a broom.
Harry Potter,Yeah.
Harry Potter,Battle a dragon.
Harry Potter,The horntail...
Harry Potter,Nothing.
Harry Potter,Who wants me to open it? You want me to open it?
Harry Potter,What the bloody hell was that?
Harry Potter,Caught on have you. Took you long enough.
Harry Potter,Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better.
Harry Potter,Hagrid warned me about the dragons.
Harry Potter,Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental.
Harry Potter,Well it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?
Harry Potter,Oi! Never gonna let him forget this are you?
Harry Potter,Why do they always have to travel in packs? How are you supposed to get one alone to ask them...
Harry Potter,I think I'd take the dragon right now.
Harry Potter,But then again he can take himself.
Harry Potter,Agreed.
Harry Potter,Cho!
Harry Potter,Ok thanks. Cho?
Harry Potter,Um.  I just wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me?
Harry Potter,Um. I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.
Harry Potter,Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good.
Harry Potter,What happened to you?
Harry Potter,What did she say?
Harry Potter,Don't be silly.
Harry Potter,What did you do then?
Harry Potter,Hey!
Harry Potter,My dress robes.
Harry Potter,Well I expect yours are more traditional.
Harry Potter,Leave it alone.
Harry Potter,Who?
Harry Potter,Because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did.
Harry Potter,Ready professor?
Harry Potter,No.
Harry Potter,Yeah she does.
Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter,Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.
Harry Potter,What's that supposed to mean?
Harry Potter,Cedric.
Harry Potter,Spectacular.
Harry Potter,Forget about it. I'm sure you would have done the same for me.
Harry Potter,I must be out of my mind.
Harry Potter,Myrtle!
Harry Potter,"Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say try putting it in the water?"
Harry Potter,"Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the black lake are there?"
Harry Potter,Come seek us where our voices sound.
Harry Potter,An hour long you'll have to look.
Harry Potter,Potentially problematic? When was the last time you held your breath under the water for an hour Hermione?
Harry Potter,"Neville. No offense, but I really don't care about plants. Now if there's a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour then great."
Harry Potter,You're sure about this Neville.
Harry Potter,For an hour.
Harry Potter,Most likely?
Harry Potter,You're telling me this now? You must be joking.
Harry Potter,Well that makes you sight better than Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway?
Harry Potter,Do I?
Harry Potter,But she's my friend too!
Harry Potter,Hermione
Harry Potter,I finished last Hermione.
Harry Potter,Mr Crouch?
Harry Potter,I can come back later Professor.
Harry Potter,Agh!
Harry Potter,Professor?
Harry Potter,"Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened to him?"
Harry Potter,"It's just that I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort was there only he wasn't quite human, and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's son."
Harry Potter,"Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these dreams, what I see, you don't think it's actually happening do you?"
Harry Potter,Yes sir.
Harry Potter,Bubble juice sir?
Harry Potter,I haven't stolen anything.
Harry Potter,Fleur? Fleur!
Harry Potter,No stop! He's bewitched Cedric.
Harry Potter,He's bewitched!
Harry Potter,For a moment so did I.
Harry Potter,Some game.
Harry Potter,"Together, on three. One, two, three!"
Harry Potter,"Yeah, you?"
Harry Potter,I've been here before.
Harry Potter,"I've been here before in a dream. Cedric, we have to get back to the cup? Now!"
Harry Potter,Get back to the cup!
Harry Potter,Cedric!
Harry Potter,Don't touch him.
Harry Potter,Have it your way.
Harry Potter,"He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back. Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him, not there."
Harry Potter,Not so much now.
Harry Potter,The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched it.
Harry Potter,Who?
Harry Potter,I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams. One of my nightmares.
Harry Potter,Um. I don't think I said anything about a graveyard Professor.
Harry Potter,It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched Krum. But...
Harry Potter,"That's Moody, but then who's...?"
Harry Potter,"Professor, when I was in the graveyard there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected."
Harry Potter,No I don't think so.
Harry Potter,Yes.
Harry Potter,"Big D? Cool name, but to me, you'll always be Ikkle Duddicums."
Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter,"Shut up, Dudley. I'm warning you..."
Harry Potter,Because if you don't I'll turn you into the idiot pig you are!
Harry Potter,"Not so brave now, are you Duddykins? Now tell your little friends to go away."
Harry Potter,Don't you ever speak about that again. You understand?
Harry Potter,"I said, DO YOU UNDERSTAND? !"
Harry Potter,Quiet!
Harry Potter,Dudley! Run!
Harry Potter,"Come on! They break into a run. A dementor drifts into the alleyway in front of them. Skidding to a stop, Harry turns around, to find the other dementor cutting off the way back."
Harry Potter,"Dudley, no!"
Harry Potter,Lumos!
Harry Potter,"""Expecto Patronum!'"
Harry Potter,"""Expecto Patronum! '"
Harry Potter,Dementors.
Harry Potter,No.
Harry Potter,We were attacked.
Harry Potter,"They're evil. If they get the chance, they'll suck your soul out through your mouth."
Harry Potter,You can't give a Dementor the 'ol one-two.'
Harry Potter,Because I used magic to save his
Harry Potter,Lumos!
Harry Potter,What are you doing here?
Harry Potter,How'd he know? It just happened!
Harry Potter,What's been going on? What's Lord Vol-
Harry Potter,How are we getting there?
Harry Potter,"Uh, is that very likely?"
Harry Potter,Expecto--!
Harry Potter,No!
Harry Potter,But I can help!
Harry Potter,Was that your--?
Harry Potter,But...why here?
Harry Potter,Mrs. Weasley!
Harry Potter,Right.
Harry Potter,"So, why's he keeping me in the dark?"
Harry Potter,Didn't you bother asking?
Harry Potter,So I get to spend the summer with the Dursleys while you two are here.
Harry Potter,You've still been here!
Harry Potter,What's been going on?
Harry Potter,What's this Order everyone's talking about?
Harry Potter,Why?
Harry Potter,Okay.
Harry Potter,I'm not really hungry. I think I'll go to bed.
Harry Potter,"I wanted to, but I didn't think you'd tell me anything."
Harry Potter,Where's Voldemort? What's he doing?
Harry Potter,How?
Harry Potter,And what's his plan?
Harry Potter,And you're stopping him from gaining followers?
Harry Potter,But...why?
Harry Potter,"But you're telling people, right?"
Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter,What kind of weapon?
Harry Potter,"No, my scar kept hurting."
Harry Potter,Yeah...nerves...
Harry Potter,"Thanks, Hermione."
Harry Potter,Bye.
Harry Potter,Department of Mysteries?
Harry Potter,I've been there before...
Harry Potter,Er...sorry.
Harry Potter,Yes.
Harry Potter,"Yes, but-"
Harry Potter,"Yes, but-"
Harry Potter,Yes.
Harry Potter,But I did it because of the Dementors!
Harry Potter,"My cousin and I were attacked by Dementors. That's why I had to use the Patronus, to drive them away."
Harry Potter,"I think so, yeah."
Harry Potter,Er...is Percy mad at you?
Harry Potter,What are you doing here?
Harry Potter,"If he wanted to talk to the Minister, why down here?"
Harry Potter,Yeah...just...my scar...the pain is getting stronger.
Harry Potter,My parents.
Harry Potter,"I miss them, Sirius..."
Harry Potter,"Why'd they have to die, Sirius, why?"
Harry Potter,Thanks.
Harry Potter,Who..who was that?
Harry Potter,I'm sure. Nothing.
Harry Potter,"So...congratulations Ron, Hermione..."
Harry Potter,"Yes, do go enjoy yourselves."
Harry Potter,What is that?
Harry Potter,"Yes it is, it's right there!"
Harry Potter,Er...you are?
Harry Potter,"Well, thanks Luna."
Harry Potter,Hagrid's cabin looks deserted.
Harry Potter,"Yeah, could be."
Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter,Why?
Harry Potter,What did I do?
Harry Potter,Where'd she get that from?
Harry Potter,"No one believes me, Hedwig. No one..."
Harry Potter,I'm alone...
Harry Potter,"Sorry, Professor..."
Harry Potter,What good's theory in the real world?
Harry Potter,What about Lord Voldemort?
Harry Potter,It-is-NOT-a-LIE!
Harry Potter,"So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead? Or are you calling me a murderer?"
Harry Potter,It was MURDER! I saw it happen!
Harry Potter,"Yeah, talk to somebody who cares."
Harry Potter,Yeah. But she called me a liar!
Harry Potter,"Yes, Professor."
Harry Potter,Oh! Sorry...
Harry Potter,"I'll never get out of it, Angelina."
Harry Potter,"Later, I've got detention."
Harry Potter,Thanks.
Harry Potter,There's no ink.
Harry Potter,"No, I haven't."
Harry Potter,She is. But the quill has some sort of spell on it. It uses blood for ink.
Harry Potter,"No, I'm telling anyone."
Harry Potter,No!
Harry Potter,I don't need his help. I don't need anyone's help.
Harry Potter,I've asked Sirius about it.
Harry Potter,"Don't worry, Hermione, I wrote it in code. Anyway, I figured I need to tell someone about Umbridge. My scar hurt again last night in detention."
Harry Potter,"Well, it's a possibility, isn't it?"
Harry Potter,"Yeah, but Dumbledore didn't have a choice, did he? She'd been sent here by the Ministry."
Harry Potter,Er...
Harry Potter,"Where are we going, Hermione?"
Harry Potter,"Hermione, what's going on?"
Harry Potter,You mean about us teaching ourselves?
Harry Potter,"Hey, Neville."
Harry Potter,"Uh...same to you, Luna."
Harry Potter,That's the first time you've said his name.
Harry Potter,"It's okay, Hermione."
Harry Potter,I believe Voldemort's back because I fought him last year. Dumbledore's already told the school that. If you didn't believe him you won't believe anyone.
Harry Potter,Me?
Harry Potter,"Uh...well, yeah, I did."
Harry Potter,That might work. I'll look into that.
Harry Potter,Yeah.
Harry Potter,What's she done now?
Harry Potter,"""By order of the Hogwarts High Inquisitor: All student organizations, societies, teams, groups, and clubs are henceforth disbanded. Permission to reform must be approved by High Inquisitor Umbridge. No student organization can exist without the knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor. Any student found to be a part of an illegal organization will be expelled immediately."""
Harry Potter,"Not only that, but what about the"
Harry Potter,This isn't a coincidence.
Harry Potter,She knows.
Harry Potter,"Look, we don't know how many people could have overheard our meeting and told her."
Harry Potter,"What would we do without you, Hermione?"
Harry Potter,Hedwig!
Harry Potter,It's Hedwig. I think she's been attacked.
Harry Potter,London.
Harry Potter,"Yes, Professor."
Harry Potter,Dobby! What are you doing here?
Harry Potter,"What is it, Dobby."
Harry Potter,"Don't worry about it, Dobby. But I don't think you can help me."
Harry Potter,"Actually, there is something you can do, Dobby."
Harry Potter,I need a room where twenty-eight people can practice Defense Against the Dark Arts without the teachers knowing. Especially Professor Umbridge.
Harry Potter,"That's brilliant, Dobby!"
Harry Potter,"Better not, Dobby. School is pretty intense right now. We'll do it ina few months, before the holidays."
Harry Potter,"Just ignore them, Ron!"
Harry Potter,Malfoy provoked us.
Harry Potter,Ban us...for life.
Harry Potter,You've--!
Harry Potter,You can't!
Harry Potter,"If you quit, we'll be out four players!"
Harry Potter,"Hagrid, what happened to you?"
Harry Potter,"We know you were looking for giants, Hagrid. Dumbledore said so last year."
Harry Potter,So what did you do when you found them?
Harry Potter,Glad to see all of you could find this place all right.
Harry Potter,Loads of Defense Against the Dark Arts equipment. Hopefully we'll be able to get to all of it before the end of term.
Harry Potter,"Besides, it works. I used it against You-Know-Who last June. It saved my life."
Harry Potter,"Right. Well, let's split into pairs and give it a go."
Harry Potter,"Well done, Neville!"
Harry Potter,"Look here, you lot! Neville's really got the hang of this one."
Harry Potter,"Never forget this spell, Neville. It could save your live some day."
Harry Potter,"Okay, everyone. We've done a lot today, and I've seen some great improvement. That's it for now. We'll meet back here, same time next week!"
Harry Potter,Mr. Weasley's been attacked!
Harry Potter,"No, I saw it happen! I...I was there..."
Harry Potter,Oh. Uh...I was the snake. I saw it from the snake's perspective.
Harry Potter,Yes!
Harry Potter,"What's that, Professor?"
Harry Potter,Voldemort can read minds?
Harry Potter,So he could read our minds right now?
Harry Potter,"But hasn't it helped so far? I mean, it saved Mr. Weasley's life, didn't it?"
Harry Potter,What are you going to do?
Harry Potter,No!
Harry Potter,I've been there before...
Harry Potter,I've just realized...
Harry Potter,"What's in the Department of Mysteries, sir?"
Harry Potter,"That corridor, I've been dreaming about it for months...it leads to the Department of Mysteries, I'm sure of it."
Harry Potter,It's got to be.
Harry Potter,"Probably. Mr. Weasley was probably there when he was attacked, too. That must be what the Order's guarding!"
Harry Potter,They're all Death Eaters!
Harry Potter,Voldemort.
Harry Potter,"Professor, no!"
Harry Potter,"I'm so sorry, Professor!"
Harry Potter,Are you sure you can't? Hagrid said it was important.
Harry Potter,"Could you tell us what it is, Hagrid, please?"
Harry Potter,Yeah.
Harry Potter,No!
Harry Potter,I--sorry!
Harry Potter,"No, of course not!"
Harry Potter,"No--no, I've done all I can."
Harry Potter,Voldemort! He's got Sirius! In the Department of Mysteries!
Harry Potter,I just saw it.
Harry Potter,How're we going to get there?
Harry Potter,We've got to do something!
Harry Potter,I won't let Sirius die!
Harry Potter,Voldemort's broken into the Department of Mysteries. He's got Sirius there!
Harry Potter,"There isn't anyone else, Hermione! Everyone from the Order is gone!"
Harry Potter,"No, there isn't!"
Harry Potter,How?
Harry Potter,That's all we'll need.
Harry Potter,Grimmauld Place!
Harry Potter,Sirius! Lupin? Hello?
Harry Potter,"Kreacher, where's Sirius?"
Harry Potter,"You know where he is, don't you?"
Harry Potter,It's none of your business.
Harry Potter,He's got Padfoot at the place it's hidden!
Harry Potter,You sent the Dementors?
Harry Potter,"Hermione, no!"
Harry Potter,I would rather die!
Harry Potter,"Great plan, Hermione."
Harry Potter,We've got no brooms.
Harry Potter,What are those?
Harry Potter,"All right, then. Get on one, and we'll be off."
Harry Potter,"All right, come on."
Harry Potter,Where is everyone?
Harry Potter,That's how Voldemort got in unnoticed.
Harry Potter,This is it. Come on.
Harry Potter,Stay close.
Harry Potter,"I don't understand. In my dream,"
Harry Potter,Yeah. I'll know the way when I see it.
Harry Potter,Who's there?
Harry Potter,Sirius?
Harry Potter,Does anyone else hear that?
Harry Potter,Sirius...yeah...
Harry Potter,Alohomora!
Harry Potter,"Whatever's in there, the Ministry sure doesn't want anyone getting to it."
Harry Potter,This is it! Come on!
Harry Potter,This is it. This is where Sirius is!
Harry Potter,He's in here somewhere.
Harry Potter,What's my name doing here?
Harry Potter,Why not?
Harry Potter,It's got my name on it!
Harry Potter,Where's Sirius?
Harry Potter,What prophesy?
Harry Potter,Go ahead.
Harry Potter,Come and find out!
Harry Potter,You even try to take her and I'll smash this thing.
Harry Potter,"So, what kind of prophesy are we talking about here?"
Harry Potter,Not really. How come Voldemort wants it?
Harry Potter,"Hey, did you know Voldemort's a half-blood too?"
Harry Potter,What's so special about this
Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter,"So he used me to do his dirty work, did he?"
Harry Potter,Now!
Harry Potter,Where'd the rest go?
Harry Potter,Stupify!
Harry Potter,Stupify!
Harry Potter,Ron!
Harry Potter,Pretificus Totalus!
Harry Potter,Hermione!
Harry Potter,"Please don't be dead, please don't be dead... He shakes her."
Harry Potter,Can we carry her?
Harry Potter,I don't know...
Harry Potter,What happened.
Harry Potter,"We need to get out of here. Luna, can you help Ginny?"
Harry Potter,Let my friends go and I will.
Harry Potter,"Stop, Neville!"
Harry Potter,Are you all right?
Harry Potter,You come with us!
Harry Potter,Protego!
Harry Potter,No...no...no....
Harry Potter,I'LL KILL you!!
Harry Potter,Stupify!
Harry Potter,Crucio!
Harry Potter,Can't. It got smashed by accident!
Harry Potter,"How's Voldemort going to like that? You've failed him, and he's not very forgiving, is he?"
Harry Potter,"He can't hear you from here, you know!"
Harry Potter,Look out!
Harry Potter,Professor!
Harry Potter,No you don't!
Harry Potter,You don't have a clue! You can't possibly know!
Harry Potter,I don't care! I don't care!
Harry Potter,Let me out.
Harry Potter,You can't keep me in here!
Harry Potter,I already know all this.
Harry Potter,"Well, yeah, I did..."
Harry Potter,But Snape stopped giving me lessons.
Harry Potter,"He barely taught me, though. I always felt more open to it after the lessons. Like he was trying to open me to Voldemort—-"
Harry Potter,Sirius didn't trust him. Didn't believe he'd really turned to our side...
Harry Potter,"I've been dreaming about that all year, before Voldemort discovered the connection."
Harry Potter,But I checked Grimmauld Place! Kreacher said--
Harry Potter,Why?
Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter,"Wait, where was Sirius when I tried to contact him?"
Harry Potter,And Hermione said we should be nice to Kreacher!
Harry Potter,Sirius hated him.
Harry Potter,"Yeah, he really hated that place. And you kept him locked up in there!"
Harry Potter,She never loved me.
Harry Potter,I asked you why Voldemort tried to kill me.
Harry Potter,"I don't understand, Professor."
Harry Potter,"Professor, why am I so important to"
Harry Potter,"Sir, it got smashed."
Harry Potter,"I'm not sure I understand all that, sir..."
Harry Potter,And...it means me?
Harry Potter,"So it's not necessarily me, sir?"
Harry Potter,What if he chose wrong?
Harry Potter,Why didn't he wait? Why attack when we were babies?
Harry Potter,But I don't have any special powers.
Harry Potter,"What is it, sir?"
Harry Potter,One of us has to kill the other...in the end.
Harry Potter,"Hey, Nick."
Harry Potter,Oh. Thanks.
Harry Potter,"Nick, I was wondering about something?"
Harry Potter,Expecting what?
Harry Potter,I expect so...
Harry Potter,Why?
Harry Potter,How are you?
Harry Potter,Better.
Harry Potter,I've got something to tell you. Something important.
Harry Potter,But not right now. I'm not ready.
Harry Potter,Do you need any help looking?
Harry Potter,Yeah.
Harry Potter,I'm sorry.
Harry Potter,Isn't it?
Harry Potter,I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me.
Harry Potter,That even though we've got a fight ahead of us we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have.
Harry Potter,Something worth fighting for
Harry Potter,Oh.  Um.  No one.  Bit of a tosser.
Harry Potter,Really.
Harry Potter,Hey.  I was wondering...
Harry Potter,I like riding round on the trains. It takes my mind off... things.
Harry Potter,"I just Apparated, didn't I?"
Harry Potter,Can't imagine why...
Harry Potter,"After all these years, I just sort of roll with it, sir."
Harry Potter,"My mother's eyes, yeah."
Harry Potter,One of my best friends is Muggle- born.  She's the best in our year.
Harry Potter,"Sir, exactly what was that all --"
Harry Potter,"It's alright, sir.  I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse --"
Harry Potter,"But, sir.  What about Hedwig?  And there's my trunk --"
Harry Potter,Sir?
Harry Potter,Really.
Harry Potter,Didn't know. Dumbledore.
Harry Potter,When'd you get here?
Harry Potter,Oh come on...
Harry Potter,But we're talking about Hogwarts. Dumbledore. What could be safer?
Harry Potter,Rubbish.  He's only -- what?
Harry Potter,Amazing.
Harry Potter,Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder?
Harry Potter,Reckon he's right...
Harry Potter,Good.  Bad.  Speaking of which...
Harry Potter,Dunno.  Let's get closer.
Harry Potter,I don't know.  I'm turned around.
Harry Potter,What just happened?
Harry Potter,"Don't you see, it was a ceremony. An initiation."
Harry Potter,It's happened.  He's one of them.
Harry Potter,So what's he doing in Borgin and Burke's?  Browsing for furniture?
Harry Potter,"Look.  His father's a Death Eater. It only makes sense.  Besides, Hermione saw it.  With her own eyes."
Harry Potter,I need some air.
Harry Potter,Luna.  How'd you...?
Harry Potter,"Sorry I made you miss the carriages, Luna."
Harry Potter,"I am your friend, Luna."
Harry Potter,"Professor Flitwick, you've known me for five years."
Harry Potter,Have you ever fixed one?  A nose.
Harry Potter,What the hell.  Give it a go.
Harry Potter,Well?  How do I look?
Harry Potter,Brilliant.
Harry Potter,Later.  What've I missed?
Harry Potter,Thanks...
Harry Potter,This can't be good.
Harry Potter,"Well, you see, I've got an open period this morning, Professor --"
Harry Potter,It is.  Or was.  But I was told I had to get an Outstanding in my
Harry Potter,Really?  Well... brilliant.  I'll head there straight away.
Harry Potter,"Um, sorry, sir, but I haven't got my book yet -- nor's Ron.  You see --"
Harry Potter,Crush it.  Don't cut it.
Harry Potter,No.  Really --
Harry Potter,"Fine, sir."
Harry Potter,"I think he overestimates my abilities, sir."
Harry Potter,Definitely.
Harry Potter,Sir?
Harry Potter,No!  I mean... she's brilliant. And we're friends.  But... no.
Harry Potter,"Did you know, sir?  Then?"
Harry Potter,"You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you, sir?"
Harry Potter,You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.
Harry Potter,Do you want me to let him?
Harry Potter,All right!  Queue up!  Excuse me...
Harry Potter,Thanks.  All right.  This morning I'll be putting you all through a few drills to assess your strengths.  But know this:  Just because you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year.  Is that clear?
Harry Potter,"All right.  Cormac.  Ron.  It's down to you two for Keeper.  We'll decide it with a shootout. Demelza, you'll bring the Quaffle up against Cormac.  Ginny, you'll take on Ron."
Harry Potter,Quiet!  I'm Captain.  We do it my way.  Now line up.  On three. One.  Two... Three!
Harry Potter,"C'mon, Ron..."
Harry Potter,Ever heard of this spell?
Harry Potter,No.
Harry Potter,It's... old.  The binding is fragile.
Harry Potter,"I didn't say I wasn't curious. And, by the way, I don't sleep with it."
Harry Potter,The library.
Harry Potter,And?
Harry Potter,Good.  That settles it then.
Harry Potter,Who's up for a Butterbeer?
Harry Potter,No.  Over here.
Harry Potter,"No, no.  Sit next to me."
Harry Potter,"Hello, sir.  Wonderful to see you."
Harry Potter,"So what brings you here, sir?"
Harry Potter,"I'd consider it an honor, sir."
Harry Potter,Dumbledore asked me to... get to know him.
Harry Potter,Dunno.  But it must be important. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn't ask.
Harry Potter,There's no time!
Harry Potter,"She was cursed, wasn't she?  I know Katie.  Off the Quidditch pitch she wouldn't hurt a fly.  If she was bringing that to someone, she wasn't doing it knowingly."
Harry Potter,It was Malfoy.
Harry Potter,I... just... know.
Harry Potter,What does she see in him?
Harry Potter,You called him a slick git not five hours ago.
Harry Potter,I suppose.
Harry Potter,I don't know.  She's smart. Funny.  Attractive...
Harry Potter,You know.  She's... got nice skin.
Harry Potter,"Well, no.  I mean... I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor."
Harry Potter,"I've never really thought about it.  But I suppose, yeah.  Very nice."
Harry Potter,I think I'll be going to sleep now.
Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter,"Sorry, sir, I was just admiring your hourglass."
Harry Potter,I think I'll be going.
Harry Potter,"The shelf, sir?"
Harry Potter,"I don't really know how to answer that, sir."
Harry Potter,"Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?"
Harry Potter,"You knew him, didn't you, sir? Tom Riddle.  You were his teacher."
Harry Potter,What was he like?
Harry Potter,"I'm sorry, sir.  Forgive me.  He killed my parents, you see..."
Harry Potter,Have it your way.  Juice?
Harry Potter,Dunno what you're talking about.
Harry Potter,Yep.  Apparently it's his lucky day.
Harry Potter,"Yeah.  I suppose I could've just used, I dunno... a Confundus charm?"
Harry Potter,Ah.  Well... they're really good.
Harry Potter,It feels like this.
Harry Potter,Have you?
Harry Potter,"I just thought, you know, since neither one of us can take who we'd really like... maybe we'd go together.  As friends."
Harry Potter,So who are you taking?
Harry Potter,Really...?
Harry Potter,But I am the Chosen One.
Harry Potter,Okay.  Kidding.  I'll just ask someone I like.  Someone cool.
Harry Potter,Neville...?
Harry Potter,What're you doing?
Harry Potter,And what's happened to you?
Harry Potter,Cormac!  That's who you invited!
Harry Potter,I think she went to powder her nose.
Harry Potter,Dragon balls.
Harry Potter,"I think I should rejoin the party, sir.  My date..."
Harry Potter,A message...?
Harry Potter,Traveling?  Where?
Harry Potter,Positive.  Why?
Harry Potter,"I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough."
Harry Potter,Lovely.
Harry Potter,I'll take your word for it.
Harry Potter,So what happens?  If you break an Unbreakable Vow?
Harry Potter,"Draco's plotting something, I know it, something to do with Voldemort.  He's been given a task or a mission -- and Snape was offering to help."
Harry Potter,I know it sounds mad --
Harry Potter,That's not what it sounded like.
Harry Potter,But Dumbledore can make mistakes. He's said it himself --
Harry Potter,I'm not --
Harry Potter,It's good.
Harry Potter,"Are you alright, Mr. Weasley?"
Harry Potter,Did you get my owl?
Harry Potter,Go on.
Harry Potter,A Vanishing Cabinet?
Harry Potter,What happened to it?  The one at Borgin & Burkes?
Harry Potter,Soon.
Harry Potter,"I know who I am, Hermione, alright?"
Harry Potter,"If Dumbledore's traveling places, it's news to the Ministry.  But get this:  that night at Borgin & Burkes?  It seems Draco was looking at a Vanishing Cabinet."
Harry Potter,You tell me.
Harry Potter,Who could tell the difference?
Harry Potter,I don't understand -- what happened?
Harry Potter,But why would he tamper with his own memory?
Harry Potter,Why?
Harry Potter,"I don't know him that well, sir --"
Harry Potter,"Well, sir, I wondered if I might ask you something."
Harry Potter,"Well, you see, the other day I was in the Restricted Section -- in the library -- and I stumbled upon something rather odd while reading.  Something about a bit of rare magic..."
Harry Potter,"I'm not sure... That is, I don't recall the name... exactly.  But it got me wondering... Are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach?"
Harry Potter,"Yes, well, we don't exactly see eye-to-eye, sir.  What I mean to say is, he's not like you.  He might... misunderstand."
Harry Potter,"Did you say the same to Tom Riddle, sir?  When he came asking questions."
Harry Potter,Sir --
Harry Potter,Nice.
Harry Potter,Hermione.  I think Malfoy's leaving the castle.
Harry Potter,I've seen it.  Sometimes... sometimes he just disappears off the Map.
Harry Potter,The Map is never wrong.
Harry Potter,"Divine.  Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?"
Harry Potter,Or twenty.
Harry Potter,"Really?  Honestly, I reckoned she was starting to annoy you."
Harry Potter,Excuse me?
Harry Potter,Well... Brilliant.
Harry Potter,Bloody well hope so.  She's been snogging you for three months.
Harry Potter,Who're you talking about?
Harry Potter,Okay.  Very funny.
Harry Potter,What the hell was that for?
Harry Potter,Okay!  Fine!  You're in love with her!  Have you ever actually met her!
Harry Potter,"Ron, these chocolates, they're -- C'mon.  I'm going to introduce you to Romilda Vane."
Harry Potter,Devastatingly handsome.
Harry Potter,Sir.  I'm sorry.  I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely --
Harry Potter,"I figured this called for a more practiced hand, sir."
Harry Potter,"I'm sorry, sir.  About the other day.  Our... misunderstanding."
Harry Potter,"I mean, I'm sure you're tired of it, after all these years.  The questions.  About... Voldemort."
Harry Potter,"Yes, sir.  It's just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.  It seemed sensible."
Harry Potter,Love potion.
Harry Potter,"Ron!  Ron!!!  Professor, help him!"
Harry Potter,Professor!  Do something!!
Harry Potter,He's choking!!
Harry Potter,"Breathe!  C'mon, Ron, don't be a prat.  Breathe!  BREATHE!"
Harry Potter,"How are you, Katie?"
Harry Potter,Sectumsempra!
Harry Potter,The Room of Requirement...
Harry Potter,Who showed you this?  First.
Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter,Oh.  Yeah.
Harry Potter,Say that again.
Harry Potter,Excellent.  Really excellent.
Harry Potter,Right.  I'm going down to Hagrid's.
Harry Potter,"No.  I've got a good feeling about going to Hagrid's.  I feel like it's the place to be tonight, know what I mean?"
Harry Potter,Trust me.  I know what I'm doing. Or at least Felix does.
Harry Potter,"Sorry, sir.  I should've announced myself.  Cleared my throat. Coughed.  You probably feared I was Madam Sprout."
Harry Potter,"Just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around.  The jumping when you saw me.  By the way, those Tentacula leaves -- they're quite valuable, aren't they?"
Harry Potter,"Personally, these plants have always kind of freaked me out."
Harry Potter,"Through the front doors, sir.  I'm off to Hagrid's, you see.  He's a very dear friend and I felt like paying him a visit.  So if you don't mind, I'll be going."
Harry Potter,Sir?
Harry Potter,"Well, then by all means come along, sir."
Harry Potter,"That would be counterproductive, sir."
Harry Potter,No idea.
Harry Potter,"A dead one, I think, sir."
Harry Potter,Not to mention the pincers.
Harry Potter,Through the front doors.
Harry Potter,Oh yeah.
Harry Potter,Do you know why I survived?  The night I got this.
Harry Potter,Because of her.  Because she sacrificed herself.  Because she refused to step aside.  Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.
Harry Potter,"I'm not afraid of the name, Professor.  And I'm not afraid of him.  And you shouldn't be either. She didn't just die for me that night.  She died for you too.  She died for everyone who's ever woken in the middle of the night afraid a Death Eater waited on their doorstep."
Harry Potter,"Professor.  I'm going to tell you something, something others have only guessed at.  It's true.  I am the Chosen One."
Harry Potter,"Only I can kill him.  But in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago. And I need to know what you told him."
Harry Potter,"Be brave, Professor.  Be brave like my mother.  Otherwise you disgrace her.  Otherwise she died for nothing.  Otherwise, the bowl remains empty forever."
Harry Potter,Sir --
Harry Potter,"Do you mean to say he succeeded, sir?  In making a Horcrux?"
Harry Potter,Seven.  He made seven -- the most powerfully magical number.  But... what are they exactly?
Harry Potter,Tom Riddle's diary --
Harry Potter,And the ring...?
Harry Potter,... even more difficult to destroy. But if you could find them all. If you did destroy each Horcrux...
Harry Potter,"But how would you find them?  They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they..."
Harry Potter,"It's where you've been going, isn't it, sir?  When you leave the school."
Harry Potter,"Hermione, is the Room of Requirement unplottable?"
Harry Potter,It would explain why I thought Malfoy was leaving the castle when he disappeared off the Map.
Harry Potter,He was going to the Room of Requirement.
Harry Potter,But I'm telling you.  I saw it --
Harry Potter,What if there are two?  Vanishing cabinets.
Harry Potter,I don't know...
Harry Potter,I don't need luck.  I'll be with Dumbledore.
Harry Potter,"You look the same to me, sir."
Harry Potter,"Yes, sir."
Harry Potter,My word.
Harry Potter,"Sir, I thought one couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts."
Harry Potter,"It's there, isn't it?"
Harry Potter,Sir!
Harry Potter,"You should've let me, sir."
Harry Potter,"We couldn't, perhaps, just try a Summoning Charm, sir?"
Harry Potter,Accio Horcrux!
Harry Potter,Sir... have you ever taken Felix Felicis?
Harry Potter,Professor... there are bodies in this lake.
Harry Potter,"Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?"
Harry Potter,"Why can't I drink it, sir?"
Harry Potter,Professor?
Harry Potter,Professor?  Can you hear me?
Harry Potter,"You... you can't stop, Professor. You've got to keep drinking.  Like you said.  Remember."
Harry Potter,"It will, sir.  It'll stop.  But only if you drink..."
Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter,No...
Harry Potter,One more.  Just one more.  And then -- I promise... I'll do what you say.
Harry Potter,I promise.
Harry Potter,"You did it, sir.  Look --"
Harry Potter,"I'm trying, sir.  I'm --"
Harry Potter,"Don't worry, sir.  We're nearly there."
Harry Potter,"We need to get you up to the hospital, sir, to Madam Pomfrey --"
Harry Potter,All right.  Okay.
Harry Potter,"Sir, are you... praying?"
Harry Potter,Cruciatus!
Harry Potter,Incacerata!
Harry Potter,Impedimenta!
Harry Potter,"Fight!  Fight back, you coward!"
Harry Potter,Sectumsempra!
Harry Potter,Hagrid... HAGRID!
Harry Potter,Hagrid!  You alright?
Harry Potter,"Hagrid, Dumbledore --"
Harry Potter,Do you think he would've done it. Draco?
Harry Potter,"No.  He was lowering his wand.  In the end, it was Snape.  It was always Snape.  And I did nothing..."
Harry Potter,"Yeah, strange.  Only... it's not. It's a fake."
Harry Potter,Go on.  Open it.
Harry Potter,"Dunno.  But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux.  Which means, it was a waste.  All of it."
Harry Potter,"I'm not coming back, Hermione."
Harry Potter,I have to finish what Dumbledore started. I'm not sure where that will lead me... but I'll let you and Ron konw where I am -- when I can.
Harry Potter,Yeah.  I do.  But do me a favor. When I'm around?  Keep the snogging to a minimum.
Harry Potter,"Funny, he says the same about you."
Harry Potter,You're brilliant.  You both are.
Harry Potter,I don’t know. I never realised how beautiful this place was.
Harry Potter,Time for the teary farewell.
Harry Potter,"They'll torture you.  Even Dudley. If they think you know where I'm going, they'll stop at noth--"
Harry Potter,Do you have any?  Magic?
Harry Potter,"Absolutely not.  Besides, I'm just a waste of space.  Isn't that right, Vernon?"
Harry Potter,Well... thanks.
Harry Potter,"See you, Big D."
Harry Potter,Good riddance.
Harry Potter,"I thought you were looking after the Prime Minister, Kingsley."
Harry Potter,The Trace?
Harry Potter,The real one...?
Harry Potter,No!  Absolutely not!
Harry Potter,If you think I'm going to let people risk their lives for me --
Harry Potter,This is different.  Taking that. Becoming me -- no.
Harry Potter,"Blimey, Hermione!"
Harry Potter,Yes?
Harry Potter,Here.
Harry Potter,Hagrid!  We've got to help the others!
Harry Potter,What was that?
Harry Potter,Hagrid... HAGRID...!
Harry Potter,Is no one back yet?
Harry Potter,Are you mad...?
Harry Potter,A grindylow!
Harry Potter,Who did this to him?
Harry Potter,Hedwig -- I think.  She was trying to protect me --
Harry Potter,"I trust you with my life, Hagrid. I trust everyone in this room. Understood?"
Harry Potter,No one else is going to die.  Not for me.
Harry Potter,Come with me.  Now.
Harry Potter,Wedding?
Harry Potter,I don't care about a bloody wedding -- no matter whose it is. I have to start searching for the Horcruxes.  It's the only chance we have to beat him.  And the longer we wait the stronger he gets.
Harry Potter,Yes.
Harry Potter,"Dumbledore didn't want anyone to know what it is we're doing.  If I tell you, I'd be betraying him."
Harry Potter,Maybe that's the best reason to have it.  Because of everything that's going on.
Harry Potter,"To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?"
Harry Potter,And this would be...?
Harry Potter,What's this all about?
Harry Potter,No idea.
Harry Potter,That's it then?
Harry Potter,Excuse me?
Harry Potter,"You'll forgive me, Minister.  But it's a little hard to tell the difference these days."
Harry Potter,You mean -- But that's brilliant -- I... don't know what to say.
Harry Potter,"No, 'course not.  How are you, Luna?"
Harry Potter,"Nice to meet you, sir."
Harry Potter,Sir?  May I sit down?
Harry Potter,"I found what you wrote in the Daily Prophet very moving, sir.  I take it you knew Professor Dumbledore well?"
Harry Potter,"I never even knew he had a brother, sir."
Harry Potter,"Sir, I was wondering if you'd had much contact with him before he died."
Harry Potter,"Strange, sir?"
Harry Potter,"Could you tell me from where they'd come, sir?"
Harry Potter,Just curious.  I was... close to Professor Dumbledore.
Harry Potter,Who are you talking about?
Harry Potter,Who?
Harry Potter,"Oh, right.  Slipped my mind..."
Harry Potter,Godric's Hollow?  Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric's Hollow?
Harry Potter,Excuse me?  You don't mean to say Dumbledore lived there too?
Harry Potter,Do you reckon everyone's alright at the wedding?  Maybe we should --
Harry Potter,Same.
Harry Potter,My rucksack.  With all my things. I left it back at the Burrow --
Harry Potter,You're joking.
Harry Potter,Down!
Harry Potter,Stupefy!
Harry Potter,"Lock the door, get the lights."
Harry Potter,This one's name is Rowle.  He was on the Astronomy Tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore.
Harry Potter,"It's better we wipe their memories.  We kill them, they'll know we were here."
Harry Potter,How is it they knew we were there?
Harry Potter,Hermione.  I appreciate the thought -- honestly.  But given that we were almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago...
Harry Potter,I have an idea.
Harry Potter,Mad-Eye...?
Harry Potter,Lumos.
Harry Potter,"Yeah.  They knew her.  She wrote A History of Magic, you know."
Harry Potter,I'm thinking maybe we should go talk to her.  She still lives in Godric's Hollow.  I'm thinking maybe she could help us.
Harry Potter,To the Dark Lord.  I know I will be dead long before you read this... I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it...
Harry Potter,Stop!  I order you!
Harry Potter,"Been spying on us, have you?"
Harry Potter,Ever seen this before?
Harry Potter,"Kreacher, I own this place. Sirius left it to me.  Which means I own you too."
Harry Potter,"That's right.  But there were two, weren't there?"
Harry Potter,Where's the other one?
Harry Potter,Answer her.
Harry Potter,How do you mean?
Harry Potter,"Where is it now?  Did someone take it, Kreacher?"
Harry Potter,"Who, Kreacher?  Who was it?"
Harry Potter,Find him.
Harry Potter,You mean... it remembers me?
Harry Potter,"When you turned this place over -- don't deny it! -- you found a locket, am I right?"
Harry Potter,Who was she?  This witch?
Harry Potter,It gets really tricky.
Harry Potter,This is completely mental.
Harry Potter,I'm nobody.
Harry Potter,Apparently so.
Harry Potter,Are those...?
Harry Potter,The Ministry must be hiring young these days.
Harry Potter,"How long did you say this batch of Polyjuice Potion would last, Hermione?"
Harry Potter,Ron.  You don't have a wife.
Harry Potter,"Look, we'll go with you --"
Harry Potter,Ron's been coming here since he was two years old.  It's us you should be worrying about.
Harry Potter,"I say if we don't locate Umbridge within the hour, we go find Ron and come back another day.  Deal?"
Harry Potter,Accio locket.
Harry Potter,"Ron, it's me."
Harry Potter,She went down to the courtrooms with Umbridge --
Harry Potter,"Arthur!  You know you're being tracked, don't you?"
Harry Potter,"No, Arthur.  It's a fact.  They're watching you."
Harry Potter,I'll tell you later.  Let's find Hermione.
Harry Potter,It's here...
Harry Potter,"You're lying.  And one mustn't tell lies, Dolores... Stupefy!"
Harry Potter,Expecto PATRONUM!
Harry Potter,Accio Dittany.
Harry Potter,Hermione.  His arm --
Harry Potter,What happened?  I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place.
Harry Potter,Don't be stupid.
Harry Potter,What're you doing?
Harry Potter,Tent?  Where am I supposed to find --
Harry Potter,They're great.
Harry Potter,No problem.
Harry Potter,How bad is he?
Harry Potter,"Dumbledore had a theory.  He felt that the Horcruxes would not be made out of random objects.  And he felt they wouldn't be hidden randomly either.  We know of three so far.  The ring, which according to Dumbledore belonged to Tom Riddle's grandfather.  The diary, which belonged to Tom himself. And this, which -- again, according to Dumbledore -- belonged to his mother."
Harry Potter,How d'you know?
Harry Potter,"I know.  I felt it too. It's... it's like it's ticking or something, like it has a tiny metal heart, like it's --"
Harry Potter,That's why we're going to kill it.
Harry Potter,Dissendium!
Harry Potter,Expulso!
Harry Potter,We have to keep it safe until we can figure out how to destroy it.
Harry Potter,No.
Harry Potter,"It's not a candle I can blow out, Hermione.  It always burns, even if it's just a flicker.  Can you understand that?"
Harry Potter,He's found him.  Vol--
Harry Potter,You-Know-Who.  He's found Gregorovitch --
Harry Potter,Yes.  How'd you know?
Harry Potter,You-Know-Who wants something Gregorovitch once had -- dunno what.  But he's desperate to have it.  It's as if his life depends on it.
Harry Potter,Well it sets my teeth on edge. What's he expecting to hear?  Good news?
Harry Potter,And what gets you through the day?
Harry Potter,How long before he can travel?
Harry Potter,You're not doing enough.
Harry Potter,Loads.
Harry Potter,Snatchers.
Harry Potter,Good to know your enchantments work.
Harry Potter,We have to leave.  We're not safe here.
Harry Potter,Then we'll go by foot.
Harry Potter,We're all hungry.
Harry Potter,It'll be dark soon.  We need to find a place to sleep.
Harry Potter,My turn.
Harry Potter,Maybe you could tell me now.
Harry Potter,Brilliant.
Harry Potter,O-kay.
Harry Potter,With a basilisk fang.  If you tell me you've got one of those in that bloody beaded bag of yours --
Harry Potter,It only takes in that which makes it stronger...
Harry Potter,... it can destroy Horcruxes.
Harry Potter,"You're brilliant, Hermione. Truly."
Harry Potter,There's only one problem...
Harry Potter,What's the problem?
Harry Potter,"Look, don't be shy.  If you've got something to say, spit it out."
Harry Potter,I thought you knew what you signed up for.
Harry Potter,I don't understand.  What part of this isn't living up to your expectations?  Did you think we'd be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you'd be back to Mummy by Christmas?
Harry Potter,"I've told you everything Dumbledore told me! And in case you haven't noticed, we've found a Horcrux!"
Harry Potter,"Yeah, he would.  D'you think I haven't noticed the two of you whispering behind my back?  D'you think I haven't guessed what you were thinking?"
Harry Potter,You think I don't listen!  You think I don't know what it's like --
Harry Potter,Go then.  But leave that.
Harry Potter,Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum...
Harry Potter,You were right.  It's like you said.  Snitches have flesh memories.  But I didn't catch my first Snitch with my hand.  I almost swallowed it.
Harry Potter,What do you reckon it means?
Harry Potter,"Luna's dad was wearing that, at Ron- At Bill and Fleur's wedding."
Harry Potter,Around his neck.  Like an amulet. I didn't think much of it at the time.  You know Luna -- she's always got some mad thing or the other she's carrying around.  I just figured it ran in the family.
Harry Potter,"Hermione, I've been thinking.  I -- I want to go to Godric's Hollow. It's where I was born, it's where my parents died --"
Harry Potter,"But it means something to him too, Hermione.  You-Know-Who nearly died there.  Wouldn't that be just the kind of place he'd hide a Horcrux?"
Harry Potter,"Godric's Hollow is the birthplace of Godric Gryffindor -- I mean, 'course it is.  Obvious, isn't it?"
Harry Potter,Tossed it at Neville once when he was snoring -- might've popped open.
Harry Potter,Hermione...
Harry Potter,No.  This is where I was born. I'm not returning as someone else.
Harry Potter,Do you think they'd be in there? My mum and dad?
Harry Potter,Is it -- ?
Harry Potter,No.
Harry Potter,"Happy Christmas, Hermione."
Harry Potter,Yeah.
Harry Potter,C'mon.
Harry Potter,We look like ordinary Muggles.
Harry Potter,Relax.  This is right.  I know it.
Harry Potter,"This is where they died, Hermione. This is where he murdered them."
Harry Potter,"You're Bathilda, aren't you?"
Harry Potter,"Hermione, she knew Dumbledore. She might have the sword. Besides, she's barely knee-high to a house-elf.  I think we can overpower her if it turns ugly."
Harry Potter,"She's gaga, remember?"
Harry Potter,Here.  Let me do that.
Harry Potter,Miss Bagshot?  Who is this man?
Harry Potter,His name.  Can you tell me his name?
Harry Potter,"This is him, Hermione.  The one I saw in Gregorovitch's wandshop. The thief.  Miss Bagshot, who is he?"
Harry Potter,She wants us to go upstairs.
Harry Potter,She wants me to go.  Alone.
Harry Potter,It's all right.  You stay here.
Harry Potter,Lumos.
Harry Potter,Yes.
Harry Potter,Yes.
Harry Potter,We got away.
Harry Potter,Are you alright?
Harry Potter,You've outdone yourself this time.
Harry Potter,Where are they?
Harry Potter,"Who is he, Hermione?  The thief? Did Dumbledore know him?"
Harry Potter,Well?
Harry Potter,"Tell me, Hermione.  Who is he?"
Harry Potter,"Hermione, I don't need to have read A History of Magic to know who Gellert Grindelwald is."
Harry Potter,"Get to the hard part, Hermione."
Harry Potter,And Dumbledore believed in it?
Harry Potter,'For the Greater Good.'  What does that mean?
Harry Potter,"We're young, Hermione.  And here we are, risking our lives to fight against the very thing Dumbledore supported."
Harry Potter,Where's my wand?  I'll take the watch.
Harry Potter,Hermione.  Where's my wand?
Harry Potter,It's done.
Harry Potter,It's done.
Harry Potter,Leave me yours.  You get back in the warm.  And give me that.
Harry Potter,No...
Harry Potter,Lumos! Accio Sword.
Harry Potter,Diffindo.
Harry Potter,Hermione...
Harry Potter,It was you!
Harry Potter,And the doe.  That was you as well.
Harry Potter,My Patronus is a stag.
Harry Potter,You didn't see anyone else?
Harry Potter,"But I reckon whoever cast the doe, put the sword in that pool hoping we'd find it."
Harry Potter,See that?  It knows.  It's afraid. Do it.
Harry Potter,All the more reason.
Harry Potter,Then why are you here?  Why did you come back?
Harry Potter,"I'll have to speak to it in order for it to open.  When it does, don't hesitate.  I don't know what's in here, but it'll put up a fight.  The bit of Riddle that was in his diary tried to kill me."
Harry Potter,On three.  One.  Two.  Three. Take me inside...
Harry Potter,"Stab it, Ron.  Now."
Harry Potter,Don't listen to it.
Harry Potter,Ron.  Don't listen to it!
Harry Potter,Ron.  Stab it!
Harry Potter,"We were better without you, happier without you."
Harry Potter,Ron.  It lies!  Stab it!  STAB IT!
Harry Potter,Your mother confessed that she would have preferred me as a son...
Harry Potter,"Do it, Ron!  Kill it!"
Harry Potter,"After you left, she cried for a week.  She's like my sister."
Harry Potter,You've sort of made up for it tonight.  Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcrux.
Harry Potter,That too.
Harry Potter,Hermione!
Harry Potter,Fine.  Actually... more than fine.
Harry Potter,Um... I don't know?
Harry Potter,It's a long story.
Harry Potter,It's a long story.
Harry Potter,Exactly how did you find us?
Harry Potter,It?
Harry Potter,Knew what?
Harry Potter,Keep talking 'bout that little ball of light touching your heart -- she'll come round.
Harry Potter,Yeah...
Harry Potter,Engorgio.
Harry Potter,Reducio!
Harry Potter,Nothing.
Harry Potter,Sorry?
Harry Potter,Jesus.  It was there too.
Harry Potter,Outside Gregorovitch's wand shop. on the alley wall...
Harry Potter,"Not still mad at him, are you?"
Harry Potter,Luna.
Harry Potter,"Hello, Mr. Lovegood.  I'm Harry Potter.  We met a few months back?"
Harry Potter,"Would it be okay if we came in? It won't take long, sir.  I promise."
Harry Potter,"Well, sir, we need some help."
Harry Potter,What's going on here?
Harry Potter,"Well, sir, it's about something you were wearing around your neck at the wedding.  A symbol..."
Harry Potter,"Yes!  Exactly.  What we wondered, sir, is, well, what is it?"
Harry Potter,The what?
Harry Potter,No.
Harry Potter,Sorry... I still don't really understand...
Harry Potter,Which one would you choose if you could?  Of the Deathly Hallows?
Harry Potter,The Stone.
Harry Potter,"Well, you could bring people back, couldn't you?  Mad-Eye. Dumbledore.  Sirius.  Anybody."
Harry Potter,But I have one.  The Invisibility Cloak my father left me.
Harry Potter,"And I think I've actually held the Resurrection Stone in my hands, that night in Dumbledore's office when he showed me the ring he'd destroyed, the Horcrux.  It had a symbol on it.  Now I think it was the mark of the Hallows."
Harry Potter,Sir?
Harry Potter,"Who took her, sir?"
Harry Potter,They've kidnapped Luna because he supported me.  He was just desperate.
Harry Potter,They exist.  The Hallows.
Harry Potter,"But he only wants the one, the last one.  That's what he's been looking for."
Harry Potter,"He knows where it is, You-Know- Who.  He'll have it by the end of the night.  He's found the Elder Wand."
Harry Potter,Dudely.  Vernon Dudley.
Harry Potter,The list is wrong.  I told you who I am --
Harry Potter,What did you put on me?
Harry Potter,How long will it last?
Harry Potter,Luna?
Harry Potter,Help us.
Harry Potter,Dobby? What are you doing here?
Harry Potter,You can Apparate in and out of this room? Could you take us with you?
Harry Potter,"Dobby, I want you to take Luna and Mr. Ollivander--"
Harry Potter,Stupefy.
Harry Potter,Stupefy!
Harry Potter,Hermione. You're all right. We're safe. We're all safe.
Harry Potter,"Dobby. Dobby. No, just-- Hold on. Hold on. Look, just hold on, okay? We'll fix you. Hermione will have something. In your bag. Hermione? Hermione? What is it? Help me."
Harry Potter,I want to bury him. Properly. Without magic.
Harry Potter,I need to talk to the goblin.
Harry Potter,How are you?
Harry Potter,You probably don't remember --
Harry Potter,Yes.
Harry Potter,Why did you leave Gringotts?
Harry Potter,"Alone, yes. With you, no."
Harry Potter,It's complicated. Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in her vault at Gringotts?
Harry Potter,The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need. We didn't steal it.
Harry Potter,And she never suspected?
Harry Potter,And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?
Harry Potter,Then what? The goblin twists the curl at his chin... then his eyes
Harry Potter,"She was terrified when she thought we'd been in there. She kept asking you what else we'd taken. I'd bet anything there's a Horcrux there. If we find it, we can kill it. And if we kill it, we're one step closer to killing him."
Harry Potter,I'm still working on that part.
Harry Potter,"Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you a few questions."
Harry Potter,"Can you identify these, sir?"
Harry Potter,And this?
Harry Potter,Was? Isn't it still?
Harry Potter,"What do you know about the Deathly Hallows, sir?"
Harry Potter,"But you, sir? Do you believe they exist?"
Harry Potter,You're lying. You know one exists and you told him about it. You told him about the Elder Wand and where to go looking for it.
Harry Potter,"He has found it, sir."
Harry Potter,"That's all, sir. We'll leave you to get some rest now."
Harry Potter,"Then I guess I'll just have to kill him before he finds me, sir."
Harry Potter,I reckon you should take this then.
Harry Potter,"If I can hold it, you can."
Harry Potter,I'll know. I can't explain. It's like...
Harry Potter,No. I just know. When one's near.
Harry Potter,In the morning.
Harry Potter,He'll be leaving too.
Harry Potter,"Yeah. Funny. Listen, Luna, about your father, I don't want you to think I --"
Harry Potter,Hogwarts?
Harry Potter,"It's not the place you left, you"
Harry Potter,Wouldn't know you if I didn't know you.
Harry Potter,"Sirius gave it to me. He had a matching piece. He said if I ever needed him, all I had to do was look into it."
Harry Potter,Something like that. I don't know. He died before I ever got to use it. The thing is...
Harry Potter,"You'll think I'm mental, but more than once, when I've looked into it -- I think I've seen Dumbledore."
Harry Potter,"You can give that to Hermione to hold, all right, Griphook?"
Harry Potter,C'mon. Let's do it.
Harry Potter,Imperio.
Harry Potter,How long before they come after us?
Harry Potter,"What is that, Griphook?"
Harry Potter,Griphook! What is that!
Harry Potter,Well done. Hey.
Harry Potter,Lumos !
Harry Potter,That's it. Up there.
Harry Potter,Give me the sword! The real one.
Harry Potter,"We have a deal, Griphook."
Harry Potter,Griphook! Griphook!
Harry Potter,Come on!
Harry Potter,We're dropping!
Harry Potter,He knows.
Harry Potter,I saw him.
Harry Potter,"I can't always help it, Hermione!"
Harry Potter,He's angry. But he's scared too. He's going to make sure the other Horcruxes are safe.
Harry Potter,I reckon he'll do anything to stop us from finding the rest. There's more: one of them's at Hogwarts.
Harry Potter,"Honestly, Hermione, when have any of our plans actually worked? We plan, we get there and all hell breaks loose."
Harry Potter,We'll go to Hogsmeade. To Honeydukes. Take the secret passage in the cellar.
Harry Potter,"There's something wrong with him. In the past, I could always follow his thoughts. Now everything feels disconnected."
Harry Potter,"No. It's more like he's wounded. If anything, he feels more"
Harry Potter,Expecto Patronum!
Harry Potter,You're Aberforth.
Harry Potter,Dumbledore's brother. It's you I've been seeing -- here. It's
Harry Potter,He's dead.
Harry Potter,Dung had no right selling you that. It belonged to --
Harry Potter,We need to get into Hogwarts. Dumbledore gave us a job to do.
Harry Potter,We've been hunting Horcruxes. We think the last one's in the school. But we'll need your help getting in.
Harry Potter,"If we can find it and kill it, then we kill him, and then we can end this war once and for all. We need to get into Hogwarts tonight."
Harry Potter,"Dumbledore trusted me, to see this through."
Harry Potter,Why should he...
Harry Potter,I only care about the Dumbledore I knew. I trusted him.
Harry Potter,I had no reason not to —-
Harry Potter,You're drunk.
Harry Potter,Where've you sent her?
Harry Potter,"Neville, you look..."
Harry Potter,The Carrows?
Harry Potter,"Okay. There's something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle. It could help us defeat You-Know-Who."
Harry Potter,We don't know.
Harry Potter,I realize it's not much to go on.
Harry Potter,"I think it might have something to do with Ravenclaw. It would be small, easy to conceal, valuable. Any ideas?"
Harry Potter,"Hey there. Ron smiles, about to speak, then notices Ginny's eyes have not left Harry. He frowns, speaks to Hermione."
Harry Potter,I think I can help you out with that... -.. Harry appears.
Harry Potter,And I'm afraid it's rather extensive.
Harry Potter,How dare you stand where he stood.
Harry Potter,"Tell them how it was that night. Tell then how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you... and killed him. Tell them!"
Harry Potter,I'm a Gryffindor.
Harry Potter,Time. As much as you can give me.
Harry Potter,"Is that possible, Professor?"
Harry Potter,I think you're right.
Harry Potter,"You, too, Professor."
Harry Potter,Okay. But take this. That way you can find me when you get back.
Harry Potter,"Ravenclaw Common Room. Got to start somewhere. Hermione nods, slips the Map in her beaded bag and she and Ron head off. Just before they turn the corner, Ron looks back, holds Harry's glance briefly... and then is"
Harry Potter,"I'm a bit preoccupied right now, Luna."
Harry Potter,"We'll talk later, Luna."
Harry Potter,Later.
Harry Potter,"Okay, Luna. Who've you got in mind?"
Harry Potter,It's you...
Harry Potter,"You're the Grey Lady, the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower."
Harry Potter,"I'm sorry. It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw. Rowena's daughter. Luna told me."
Harry Potter,Yes. She thought you might be able to help me.
Harry Potter,Yes! That's right --
Harry Potter,Wait! Please!
Harry Potter,But I don't care about its powers! Honestly --
Harry Potter,I don't seek it for myself! You have to believe me!
Harry Potter,I want to destroy it.
Harry Potter,"That's what you want, isn't it, Helena? You want it destroyed."
Harry Potter,"I'll end your pain, Helena. Tell me where it is and I'll destroy it, I swear, on my mother's memory —-"
Harry Potter,Tom Riddle --
Harry Potter,He's lied to many people --
Harry Potter,Thank you... -.. then turning...
Harry Potter,Thank you... -.. then running.
Harry Potter,Ginny! Neville! You alright?
Harry Potter,Luna -- ?
Harry Potter,I could ask you the same.
Harry Potter,I remember.
Harry Potter,What's wrong with the one you have?
Harry Potter,Why didn't you tell her?
Harry Potter,Bellatrix. You knew it was me. But you didn't say anything.
Harry Potter,No. I don't think so...
Harry Potter,"Besides, its allegiance is to me now. If you want it, you'll have to win it back. Perhaps even kill me..."
Harry Potter,Expelliarmus!
Harry Potter,Well done. Let's find Ron and get out of here.
Harry Potter,Split up!
Harry Potter,"No, it''ll just follow us!"
Harry Potter,Here! Take one!
Harry Potter,Wait! What about Malfoy and Blaise!
Harry Potter,"Ron, you once asked me if I thought he felt it -- Voldemort -- when we destroy a Horcrux, when we destroy a piece of his soul."
Harry Potter,He does.
Harry Potter,It's the snake. She's the last one. The last Horcrux.
Harry Potter,No. He'll keep her close.
Harry Potter,I know where he is.
Harry Potter,Give me something! Quickly! A flask! Anything.
Harry Potter,I'm going there now.
Harry Potter,It's... meant to be.
Harry Potter,There's a reason I can... hear them -- the Horcruxes.
Harry Potter,I think I've known for awhile.
Harry Potter,Kill the snake. Kill the snake and then it's just him. Then it will be over.
Harry Potter,Why are you here? All of you?
Harry Potter,Does it hurt? Dying?
Harry Potter,"I'm sorry. I didn't want any of you to die for me. And Remus, your son..."
Harry Potter,You'll stay with me?
Harry Potter,He won't be able to see you?
Harry Potter,Stay close to me.
Harry Potter,You weren't.
Harry Potter,"Sir, this, is this... I mean, forgive me, but you are dead, aren't you, sir?"
Harry Potter,Then... I'm dead too?
Harry Potter,Not?
Harry Potter,But I didn't defend myself. I let him kill me.
Harry Potter,"It's true, isn't it, sir? A bit of him lives in me, doesn't it?"
Harry Potter,And you knew this? That's why you were certain I wouldn't die?
Harry Potter,"Professor, is that -- ?"
Harry Potter,"Exactly where are we, sir?"
Harry Potter,It looks like King's Cross station -- only a lot cleaner. And without the trains.
Harry Potter,"Sir, why didn't you just tell me about the Deathly Hallows?"
Harry Potter,Sir --
Harry Potter,"You wanted to see Ariana again, didn't you, sir?"
Harry Potter,"I used the Stone as well, sir, only a little while ago when I entered the Forest. I saw my mum and dad, and Sirius and Lupin..."
Harry Potter,"I've got to go back, haven't I?"
Harry Potter,I've got a choice?
Harry Potter,And where would it take me?
Harry Potter,Voldemort's got the Elder Wand.
Harry Potter,And the snake lives.
Harry Potter,And I've nothing to kill it with.
Harry Potter,"With all due respect, sir, I think what we need here is a miracle."
Harry Potter,"Which would be, sir?"
Harry Potter,"Sir, my mother's Patronus. It was a doe, wasn't it? Just like Professor Snape's. Curious, don't you think?"
Harry Potter,Professor.
Harry Potter,Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?
Harry Potter,Confringo!
Harry Potter,The snake! We've got to kill the snake!
Harry Potter,Because I have something worth living for.
Harry Potter,Confringo!
Harry Potter,You were right.
Harry Potter,When you told Professor Snape it was failing you. It will always fail you.
Harry Potter,Together.
Harry Potter,I told you: it's useless to you.
Harry Potter,Because it answers to another.
Harry Potter,"When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his. But the thing is... it never belonged to Snape."
Harry Potter,It answers to me.
Harry Potter,"Well, it wasn't boring, was it?"
Harry Potter,Together?
Harry Potter,"There's nothing scary about thestrals. They're gentle things. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the carriages. You/'be going in the boats, remember?"
Harry Potter,Yes?
Harry Potter,Albus Severus Potter. You were named after two Headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin. And he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.
Harry Potter,"Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful wizard. But listen, if it means so much to you, you can choose Gryffindor. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account."
Harry Potter,Really.
Harry Potter,Ready?
