# Data Cleaning Project

## Description </br>
This project focuses on data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to ensure the quality and reliability of data. It aims to address common data issues, such as missing values, inconsistent formatting, outliers, and duplicates, among others. By applying various cleaning methods and algorithms, we aim to enhance the accuracy and usefulness of the data for further analysis and modeling.

## Features </br>
- Data cleaning techniques:</br>
  - Handling missing values</br>
  - Removing duplicates</br>
  - Handling outliers</br>
  - Standardizing data formats</br>
  - Correcting inconsistent data</br>
  - Dealing with data inconsistencies and errors</br>
  - Scaling and normalization</br>

- Supporting multiple data formats:</br>
  - CSV</br>
  - Excel</br>
  - JSON</br>
  - XML</br>
  - Database connections (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)</br>

- Interactive cleaning workflow:</br>
  - Configurable cleaning steps</br>
  - Preview of data transformations</br>
  - Visualizations and summaries of data quality</br>

- Data cleaning automation:</br>
  - Batch processing for large datasets</br>
  - Customizable cleaning rules and scripts</br>
  - Integration with existing data pipelines</br>

## Installation </br>
1. Clone this repository:</br>
2. Install the required dependencies : Install python liraries </br>
3. Customize the cleaning process:</br>
- Modify the cleaning steps in the `data_cleaning.ipynb` script according to your specific requirements.</br>
- Adjust the cleaning rules, algorithms, or functions in the `data_cleaning.ipynb` module to match your dataset characteristics.</br>
4. Explore the cleaned data:</br>
- Use the generated cleaned data file for further analysis, visualization, or modeling.</br>
- Review the log files and summary outputs to assess the effectiveness of the cleaning process.</br>
